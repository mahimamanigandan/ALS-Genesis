Prediction of genes causing ALS using Machine Learning

We are in the fight against ALS..!! Stay Strong..!!
We care for you..!!

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is a progressive neuro-muscular disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, causing loss of muscle control.
ALS is a genetic disease which is inherited in 5 â€“ 10% of the people. We aim to develop a machine learning model to predict the genes responsible for ALS disease which is the most important factor in determining the disease.
We propose a web application to interact with the machine learning model to assist the patients.
